      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
        Hi, I am Monica. I am a fingerstyle guitarist who loves transforming
        songs into expressive acoustic arrangements. Years of practice have
        allowed me to explore emotion, rhythm, and melody through every
        performance. I share my music for aspiring musicians and anyone who
        appreciates the beauty of instrumental guitar. My goal is to inspire
        others to learn, create, and connect with music on a deeper level, while
        sharing tutorials and personal interpretations of popular songs.
